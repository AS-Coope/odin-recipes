# Overview
This is my attempt at the first project in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/): [Recipes](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes). In my quest to learn web development, this stages itself as one of the first milestones.

# Learning Outcomes
At the end of this project, I will have:  
HTML:
- created several web pages in html
- made use of lists in html
- used links to reference images and other webpages 
- essentially, made use of all the topics in the **[HTML Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#html-foundations)** section of the **[Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations)**.
